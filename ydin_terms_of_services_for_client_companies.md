## 1. YDIN SERVICES

### 1.1. Overview

YDIN provides software consulting and development services ("Projects") for companies ("Clients") who need temporary or long-term resourcing for their software projects.

YDIN does not employ designers and developers, but instead partners with design and developer agencies ("Agencies") and subcontracts the work from them. The Agencies have YDIN Terms of Services for Developer Agencies agreement signed that provides the legal framework for Client Projects including NDA, IPR protection, and way of working.

Projects are any kind of agreed work for a Client purchased from and delivered by YDIN. Project personnel, schedule, commercial terms, etc are agreed in a separate project resourcing contract ("Project Contract") signed between Client and YDIN.

Project resourcing can consist of one or more software designers, programmers, quality assurance engineers, scrum masters, or other people involved in digital product development ("Resource", or "Resources").

For the Agencies YDIN operates as an external marketing and sales team, helping them find new Clients, negotiate Project Contracts for the Agencies, and manage and develop Client relationships during the Projects.

YDIN Services can be accessed and used through the [YDIN.com](https://YDIN.com) website and personally through your assigned account manager.

### 1.2. This Agreement

The purpose of this Agreement is to provide a framework with basic terms and conditions for both Clients and YDIN to be used in the Projects.

### 4.2. Processes and Tools

For the Project work Agency and its Resources uses its own software development processes, hardware, software, and tools.

Possible onsite work or regular visits to the Client are defined in the Project Contract.

### 4.4. Working Hours

The default working hours are 8 hours per day from Monday to Friday, expect local national public holidays in the Agency's country.

Client Project hours for invoicing are reported daily to hour reporting tool provided by YDIN (Harvest, [GetHarvest.com]( https://www.getharvest.com/)). The time recorded is rounded up to 15 minutes.

The Client can provide their own task structure to be used in hour reporting, or use YDIN’s default one for software development work.

### 4.6. Project Contract

Project Contracts are signed between the Client and the YDIN. The Client can choose the signing method from email approval, [DocuSign.com](https://www.docusign.com/) electronic signatures, or hard-copy signatures.

Before YDIN delivers the Project Contract for the Client for approval, the Agency must have approved, signed and committed to the Contract and its terms with email approval.

### 4.7. Project Contract Resourcing Changes

Agency has a right to offer the same resources to multiple Projects with YDIN and to its own projects at the same time. The Agency is obligated to inform YDIN about such double-booking.

Agency has a right to remove or change resources assigned for the Project Contract before the Client approves the proposal, e.g. if another Client approves a proposal with the same resources earlier. On such occasions, the Agency must inform YDIN immediately.

## 5. COMMERCIAL TERMS

### 5.1. YDIN Service Fee

YDIN Services are free of charge for the Clients.

YDIN takes a service fee from the Agency from all the Projects sold and delivered through YDIN Services. The model is public and transparent and defined in YDIN Terms of Services for Developer Agencies.

### 5.2. Time and Materials

The Project is invoiced from using the Time and Material model, that is, the Client is invoiced based on actual hours worked for the Project and receipts from any Project-related expenses.

### 5.3. Client Rates

The Agency decides the proposed rates used for the Project Contract proposals. The final rates are then agreed case-by-case between the Client and the Agency. 

YDIN’s role is to provide advice and recommendations based on market information, and to facilitate the negotiations and to ensure a fair deal for both the Client and the Agency.

By default, all rates are in USD, unless Client requests to some other currency.

### 5.4. Overtime Work

All overtime work must be agreed upon and approved in writing with the Client beforehand.

Overtime hours are invoiced from the client with the following overtime rates unless local legislation of the Agency states otherwise:

- Normal overtime: 1.3x normal hourly rate
- Public holiday overtime: 1.6x normal hourly rate

### 5.5. No-risk Trial

Clients have a no-risk trial period of 2 weeks for each Resource who starts in a Project. If the Client is not satisfied with a Resource, the Client does not have to pay for the first two weeks for that particular Resource, and neither YDIN nor Agency will get paid for the work of that Resource.

At the end of the trial period, YDIN confirms from the Client that the Client is satisfied with the resource, will pay for the work, and continue with the Resource.

In the case of non-payment, the Resource in question will stop in the Project immediately, and YDIN can propose another Resource as a replacement, again with a new 2 weeks trial period.

The no-risk trial period is applicable to only Projects that are at least 3 months or longer.

### 5.6. Expenses

Any Client Project expenses for reimbursement must be pre-approved in writing by Client. Agency reports the expenses to YDIN, YDIN charges from Client and reimburses to Agency after Client's payment.

Client Project expenses are reimbursed 100% to the Agency (i.e. the YDIN does not take the service fee from the expenses).

### 5.7. Client Invoicing and Payment Processing

YDIN operates as a payment processor for the payments between the Client and the Agencies.

YDIN invoices Clients at the end of each 2 weeks sprint based on the actual hours. The invoices include a detailed breakdown of the hours by Resources and tasks.

All invoices for the Clients are due net 10 days from the invoice date. 

The invoicing schedule and payment terms may have some variations depending on Clients and such variations are defined in the Project Contract.
