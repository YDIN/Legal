YDIN gives up to 50% of all of its net revenue back to Partners based on a network model rewarding Partners who have invited new Partners to join YDIN.

Partners get a share of the YDIN net revenue from all the Partners that they have invited to own network:

1. 25% from all net revenue generated by directly invited Partners.
2. 12.5% from all net revenue from the 2nd level (Partners invited by directly invited Partners).
3. 6.25% from all net revenue from the 3rd level.
4. 3.125% from all net revenue from the 4th level.
5. 1.5625% from all net revenue from the 5th level.

Revenue share entitlement is not depending on the authority to invite new partners.

### 3.4. Expenses
