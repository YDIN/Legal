## 1. YDIN SERVICES

### 1.1. Overview

YDIN provides software consulting and development services ("Projects") for companies ("Clients") who need temporary or long-term resourcing for their software projects.

YDIN does not employ designers and developers, but instead partners with design and developer agencies ("Agencies") and subcontracts the work from them.

Clients are companies and organizations with YDIN Terms of Services for Client Companies agreement signed with YDIN, typically enterprises, growth-stage startups, and high-end consulting companies.

Projects are any kind of agreed work for a Client purchased from and delivered by YDIN. Project personnel, schedule, commercial terms, etc are agreed in a separate project resourcing contract ("Project Contract") signed between Client and YDIN.

Project resourcing can consist of one or more software designers, programmers, quality assurance engineers, scrum masters, or other people involved in the digital product development ("Resource", or "Resources").

For the Agencies YDIN operates as an external marketing and sales team, helping them find new Clients, negotiate Project Contracts for the Agencies, and manage and develop Client relationships during the Projects.

YDIN Services can be accessed and used through [YDIN.com](https://YDIN.com) website and personally through your assigned account manager.

At the end of each sprint, Agency checks and ensures hours are correct for invoicing the Clients.

### 4.6. Project Contract

Project Contracts are signed between the Client and YDIN and incorporate the terms of YDIN Terms of Services for Client Companies between Client and YDIN: [GitHub.com/YDIN/legal](https://GitHub.com/YDIN/legal).

Agency has a right to offer the same resources to multiple Projects with YDIN and to its own projects at the same time. The Agency is obligated to inform YDIN about such double-booking.

Agency has a right to remove or change resources assigned for the Project Contract before the Client approves the proposal, e.g. if another Client approves a proposal with the same resources earlier. In such occasion, the Agency must inform YDIN immediately.

## 5. COMMERCIAL TERMS

### 5.1. Time and Materials

All YDIN Projects are invoiced from the Client using the Time and Material model, that is, the Client is invoiced based on actual hours worked for the Project and receipts from any Project-related expenses.

### 5.2. YDIN Service Fee

YDIN takes 12% service fee from the Client payments from all the Project sold and delivered through YDIN Services.

### 5.3. Client Rates

The Agency decides the proposed hourly rates used for the Project Contract proposals. YDIN’s role is to provide advice and recommendations based on market information.

The final rates are then agreed case-by-case between the Client and the Agency. YDIN’s role is to facilitate the negotiations and to ensure a fair deal for all Parties.

By default, all rates are in USD, unless a Client demands some other currency.

### 5.4. Overtime Work

Overtime hours are invoiced from the client with the following overtime rates unless local legislation of the Agency states otherwise:

- Normal overtime: 1.3x normal hourly rate
- Public holiday overtime: 1.6x normal hourly rate

### 5.5. No-risk Trial

Clients have a no-risk trial period of 2 weeks for each Resource who starts in a Client Project. If the Client is not satisfied with a Resource, the Client does not have to pay for the first two weeks for that particular Resource, and neither YDIN nor Agency will get paid for the work of that Resource.

At the end of the trial period, YDIN confirms from the Client that the Client is satisfied with the resource, will pay for the work, and continue with the Resource.

In the case of non-payment, the Resource in question will stop in the Project immediately, and YDIN can propose another Resource as a replacement, again with a new 2 weeks trial period.

The no-risk trial period is applicable to only Projects that are at least 3 months or longer.

### 5.6. Expenses

Any Client Project expenses for reimbursement must be pre-approved in writing by Client. Agency reports the expenses to YDIN, YDIN charges from Client and reimburses to Agency after Client's payment.

Any non-Client Project expenses that YDIN will cover must be pre-approved in writing by YDIN.

### 5.7. Non-invoiced Items

The Agency may pay its Resources per diem and/or for the hours spent on traveling e.g. to Client meetings depending on the local labor law and industry practices.

### 5.8. Client Invoicing and Payment Processing

YDIN invoices Clients at the end of each 2 weeks sprint based on the actual hours. All invoices for the Clients are due net 10 days from the invoice date. The invoicing schedule and payment terms may have some variations depending on Clients.

YDIN pays the Agency immediately after the Client payment has arrived and informs Agency about the payment with an email.

Before a Project starts, the Agency provides YDIN with bank details and account for the payments. Agency covers any transfer costs for the payments.

## 6. GENERAL
